# Vernon-Cloete---CV

HI...

This is basically just a copy I made of my CV entirely out of HTML and CSS. 
As time passes, and my skill level changes, I'll try to update as much as possible and possibly make it much more unique looking.
It currently follows a CV template used while I was employed under CapaCiTi(or CiTi), so who knows what it'll look like in the future.
Only contains the most important bits needed for a CV, no addition of sensitive documents or details have been added so to protect my identity and possibly my livelyhood (you never know who'll have malicious intent towards you, so it better safe than sorry).
