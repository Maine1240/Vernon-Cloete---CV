Hi.

This is just a restructuring of the CV we were given at while I was working for CapaCiTi, some changes have to be made to it though (which I'm well aware of) and will be busy taking care of it as soon as I have enough free time to go over everything again.

Hi Again.

t's been a pretty while, and I've been busy-busy for the past few months/year. Slightly updated the project to refelect with some of those changes so far, still have to update some things that I have forgotten about since last updating this some 10+ months ago.

Anyway, see you on the next update.
